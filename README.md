### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris and I live and work in Philadelphia. I started coding in 1983 or '84 -- starting with BASIC, first at an "intro to programming for kids" thing some grad students at NAU were doing with some IBM PCs, and then on my own Commodore 64.  I've delved into various languages over the years (C++, C#, Perl, Python) but never really got very far.  However, I decided recently that I needed to buckle down and refresh the webdev skills that I hadn't really brushed off since 2006 or so.  (Holy smokes things have changed for the better!)
